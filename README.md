Test github repo for CS-HU 250

#Welcome to my hello-world repository

This isn't my first rodeo with GitHub so I would say I am pretty familiar with how things go. But that being said, there's still a lot of stuff I have yet to learn with Git and GitHub so I am always open to learn new things.

## About me

My name is Joshua and I am a 3rd year student at Boise State University. I've been living in the downtown Boise area for nearly 2 years and I am loving it so far. I was originally from an island in the Pacific called Saipan so this is a huge jump for me. I just turned 24 (Yesterday as of writing) and I am into video games (Primarily FPS, RPG and as of recently rhythm games). I have two cats named Twig and Leaf and they are great and I love them very much!

There's not much I have to share as I don't think I have very many stuff to share so for the rest of this README, I'll just put some cool stuff that I think you should try out or watch or read when you have the time.
